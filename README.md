# Template for Rust projects using Devcontainers

This is my template when creating a new Rust Project. Using Devcontainers, I containerize my development environment to keep it consistent and use relatively strict clippy lints.
It has sensible basic Github Actions implemented for Rust and the project's dependencies.

To use, just create a repository from this template, clone and then open it using VSCode with the [Devcontainers Extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode-remote.remote-containers).
More explanation for setting up Devcontainers can be found [here](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/devcontainers/containers).
